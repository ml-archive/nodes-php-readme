# Emoji Support (UTF8MB4)

### A little background

On MySQL, the max key length is 767 bytes. We need pay attention to all the keys on the database that are based specially on the **VARCHAR** type.

For example:

- *utf8*, each character is 3 bytes. So a varchar(255) = 255 * 3 = 765 bytes (**OK**, under the limit).

- *utf8mb4*, each character is 4 bytes. So a varchar(255) = 255 * 4 = 1020 bytes (**NOT OK**)

While running a migration you wonâ€™t see MySQL 5.7 complaining about this, and everything will be created as you would expect. Except for the keys that break the limit. (MySQL fails that silently?)

### Options

2 options may be considered:

- Option 1: Do you really need 255 characters on that column?

    A good example of this is the nodes/backend package. We have backend_roles table with the column slug varchar(255) and a reference to this column on the backend_users table, on the column user_role varchar(255). Do we really need a role slug to be 255 characters? We can reduce it to 191 characters and everything would be ok (191 * 4 = 764 bytes).

    This would represent a slug like this:

    Enough? :)

- Option2: We really need 255 characters!

    If we really need all 255 characters, we can consider using this innodb setting:

### How to enable UTF8MB4 support on Laravel

Go to config -> database -> connections -> mysql and replace:

`'charset' => 'utf8'` by `'charset' => 'utf8mb4'`

`'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci'` by `'charset' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'`


**Warning:** don't forget that if you're database already exists, you need to change the collation of the database to utf8mb4.
Changing Laravel's config will not make you're database magically support utf8mb4. If you are on a new project, and you didn't migrate 
any tables yet, then when Laravel creates them (with these new configs), all the migrated tables should be utf8mb4.
